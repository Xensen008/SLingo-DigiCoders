            <h1>What is Sign Language?</h1>
            <p>Sign languages are languages that use the visual-manual modality to
                convey meaning, instead of spoken words.Wherever communities of deaf people exist, sign languages have
                developed as useful means of communication and form the core of local deaf cultures. Signing is
                used primarily by the deaf and hard of hearing. Each country generally has
                its own native sign language; some have more than one</p>
